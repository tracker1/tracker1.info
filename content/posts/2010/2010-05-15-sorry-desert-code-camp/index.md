<p>Last night, I was working on my presentations for <a href="http://desertcodecamp.com/" test="true">Desert Code Camp</a>, all night.I honestly fell asleep around 5am and didn&apos;t wake up until around 3.&#xA0; I had all my test data setup for <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/" test="true">MongoDB</a>,&#xA0; I had utilized a lot of the presentation resources from the <a href="http://www.10gen.com/event_mongosf_10apr30" test="true">MongoSF</a> conference.&#xA0; Specifically re-tooling the &quot;<a href="http://github.com/mdirolf/shell_presentation/blob/master/slides.js" test="true">powerpoint replacement</a>&quot; script from <a href="http://dirolf.com/" test="true">Michael Dirolf</a>.&#xA0; I&apos;ve got about 2-3 pages of samples and notes here on that I&apos;d like to cover.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Around 1am I was going over the node.js stuff for that presentation, amazing how much pain one mistake can bring (entered &quot;kiwi.requires(&apos;express/plugins&apos;)&quot; instead of just &quot;requires(...)&quot;.&#xA0; The nodejs demo was made with parts from <a href="http://barkingiguana.com/" test="true">Craig R. Webster</a>&apos;s &quot;<a href="http://barkingiguana.com/~craig/talks/2010/nodejs-introduction" test="true">Getting Started With Node.js</a>&quot;, and some parts centering on use of express/haml/sass thanks to the post from <a href="http://howtonode.org/express-mongodb" test="true">How To Node</a> on &quot;<a href="http://howtonode.org/express-mongodb" test="true">Blog rolling with MongoDB express and Node.js</a>&quot;.&#xA0; I had meant to get a bit in on the <a href="http://commonjs.org/" test="true">CommonJS</a> plugin conventions and a some templating with the haml and sass support, there wouldn&apos;t be time to tie it in to mongo.</p>
<p>The monday demo for <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/javascript-az" test="true">JavaScriptAZ</a> is supposed to be on jQueryUI, but I&apos;m going to use a lot of the material here for the first meeting in June on server-side-javascript.&#xA0; I&apos;m open to swapping those around if people are interested, so it isn&apos;t as far away.</p>
<p>I&apos;m making this post, containing links to those resources I was deriving my presentations from, so the information is at least out there.&#xA0; The stuff on node.js is harder to track down, as unfortunately the node.js site doesn&apos;t link to outside demos much at all, and some of the documentation, even the api docs are hard to follow.&#xA0; MongoDB&apos;s site does better, but there&apos;s still a few rough edges in how the JS console (reference client) documentation is organized.&#xA0; If you have any questions, feel free to email me.</p>
