description: A quick rant on the lack of attention Javascript (Managed JScript) is getting and a suggestion to change it to IronScript and MS-PL it like the other Iron brothers.

<p>Okay, I love Javascript.&#xA0; It is hands down my favorite language (C# is a near second).&#xA0; In fact, it was the first language I ever learned, even before having a good handle on html markup in the mid-90s.&#xA0; I used it server-side with Livewire on Netscape server.&#xA0; I transitioned to (now Cassic) ASP, and picked up vbscript (COM enumerations via JScript were so evil).&#xA0; When .Net first came out, i hacked my way through using the JScript .net command-line compiler, and early ASP.Net (ASP+), after translating a litteral ton of code from VB.Net and C# samples, I caved and learned C#.&#xA0; Allong the way, I picked up on several SQL Dialects, VB6, some perl and others; but I always get back to Javascript. [more]</p>
<p>I&apos;ve really enjoyed the resurgence of Javascript in the browser settling on prototype.js for a number of&#xA0; years, and more recently finding some love for jQuery (though I miss some language extensions prototype has).&#xA0; The DOM in today&apos;s browsers is leaps and bounds above the bad old v4 days even without convenience libraries.&#xA0; Still, Javascript is still delegated to mostly in-browser chores.&#xA0; There are several nice server-side frameworks, and even scripting engines for outside the browser, but alas, no mass love.</p>
<p>&#xA0;I started hearing about the DLR (Dynamic Language Runtime) work being done in Microsoft almost two years ago now.&#xA0; With IronPython and IronRuby being the showcase members.&#xA0; VBX (a VB interpreter) for the DLR being considered to be a much needed reprieve from the COM drenched VBA/VBScript.&#xA0; Oh, Javascript is in there too aka Managed JScript.&#xA0; Demos and code samples flourished for everything BUT Managed JScript at PDC and Mix</p>
<p>&#xA0;Why, I ask, is it that Javascript is so unloved by Microsoft, and even the developer community at large?&#xA0; Every effort is made to abstract all consciousness of Javascript from development where it is used, and elsewhere, a distant afterthought.&#xA0; Why are IronPython and IronRuby deemed worthy of FLOSS, and Managed JScript is the bastard, red-headed step-child?&#xA0; I have a proposal, that MS collectively grows a pair and renames &quot;Managed JScript&quot; to &quot;IronScript&quot; and release it like it&apos;s &quot;Iron&quot; brethren.&#xA0; Releasing the source would bring a lot of support for the outside world, and getting rid of the &quot;J&quot; could just be a F-U to the &quot;Java&quot; references and confusion altogether.</p>
<p>&#xA0;I&apos;m a Developer, I build Web Applications, and have for well over a decade now,&#xA0; and I love Javascript.&#xA0; I find the DLR compelling, and really want to see the Javascript implementation treated like a first class citizen.&#xA0; Give me code, samples and howtos.&#xA0; I&apos;m going down this path anyhow, and would rather not do it alone.</p>
