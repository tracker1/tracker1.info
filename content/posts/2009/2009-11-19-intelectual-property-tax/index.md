<p>If intelectual property in this country is to be treated and protected like real property, then why isn&apos;t it taxed as real property.&#xA0; Why aren&apos;t infringement settlements taxed at the point of transaction,the same as with physical goods?&#xA0; If we are so short of funding for government programs, why isn&apos;t the copyright and patent industry taxed like the physical production industries?</p>
