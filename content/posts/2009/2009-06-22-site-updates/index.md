<p>Okay, I&apos;ve updated the site to <a href="http://www.dotnetblogengine.net/" test="true">BlogEngine.net</a> 1.5.&#xA0; Beyond this i&apos;ve gone through all the old posts adding a MORE tag, so that there&apos;s a tear from the main listing to the full post&#xA0; From now on, only the newest post will be listed without the tear.&#xA0; I&apos;ve also updated all the older code samples to use a nice little script called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/syntaxhighlighter/" test="true">SyntaxHighlighter</a> (Okay, maybe not &quot;little,&quot; but so worth it), far better than the tag&#xA0; soup that was in there before, and degrades nicely for those with Javascript disabled (WHY?!?).</p>
<p>I&apos;ve set the site to the *stock* theme for now, i&apos;ll try to get this modded soom.&#xA0; Also, I&apos;ll be posting some updates to MySite soon, some more fun with ASP.Net MVC, Javascript goodies, and a special surprise are all in the works.</p>
