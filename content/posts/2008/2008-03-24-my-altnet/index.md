<p>Okay, this is mainly out of a discussion on ##javascript on irc.freenode.org ...&#xA0; I was asked specifically if I code in PHP... my response was &quot;I can, but don&apos;t really like it.&quot;&#xA0; This was followed with a question as to what I use... my response was ASP.Net w/ C# mostly...&#xA0; The overall response in the channel was rather negative.&#xA0; [more]I don&apos;t think people realize how nice ASP.Net is to work with, or that it can be deployed for *free* (as in open-source) thanks to the <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/" test="true">Mono Project</a> and mod_mono.</p>
<p>I recently setup a couple small applications under Ubuntu GeOS, and it worked out rather well... performance was good, and memory use wasn&apos;t *too* bad, though higher use would require more memory though. &#xA0; I guess this is just a rant overall.&#xA0; I love .Net, but I do understand why some people gather around open-source, and don&apos;t care for the politics out of Redmond, but to dismiss a framework out of hand just irks me.</p>
