<p>A couple weeks ago I got an <a href="http://www.msicomputer.com/product/p_spec.asp?model=Wind_PC&amp;class=npc" test="true">MSI Wind Barebones</a>, shoved 2gb of ram, a dvdrw, and an 80gb sata drive I had laying around.&#xA0; I ran it with Linux + XBMC for a while, and today tried setting it up as a Hackintosh, just to see if it would work.&#xA0; [more]Well, with the Kalyway 10.5.2 install everything worked, except the video resolution on it.&#xA0; After updating to 10.5.3, All I needed to do was use the AppleIntelIntegratedFramebuffer.kext from 10.5.1and all is working.&#xA0; Playing video with quicktime doesn&apos;t work so great at anything above standard (640/720x480) resolution, and even then can lag a bit.&#xA0; <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-macosx.html" test="true">VLC</a> works better, and seems capable of up to 720p (barely).&#xA0; OSX seems to not run video as well as Linux did, but the setup is pretty nice.&#xA0;&#xA0; Will likely give XP then Vista a try before going back to Linux on this machine.&#xA0;&#xA0; I got it as something to play around with, and see how well it does.</p>
<p>It is without a doubt, usable as a general use machine (no higher end gaming, or &gt; 720p video though)... For office tasks, browsing the net, and music, it works great.&#xA0; Flash video seems to push it a bit much as well... on Hulu, I was only able to play their &quot;standard&quot; res video, hirez (480p) was too much for the little thing to handle.&#xA0; Within a year, I would expect to see a dual-core atom, with a slightly higher cpu clock speed that should be a contender, as long as it gets a graphics chipset that helps with decoding tasks.</p>
