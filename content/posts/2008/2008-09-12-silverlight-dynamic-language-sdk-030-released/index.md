<p>Okay, this snuck by me a couple weeks ago, but the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/sdlsdk/" test="true">Silverlight Dynamic Languages SDK</a> 0.3.0 was pushed out on August 30th, 2008.&#xA0; Although the main focus of this SDK is for use in Silverlight, the DLR included in this SDK can be used to generate a nice, multi-language scripting environment for your own applications.</p>
