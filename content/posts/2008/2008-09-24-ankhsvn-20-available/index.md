<p>Not sure how this snuck by me without notice, but the 2.0 release of <a href="http://ankhsvn.open.collab.net/servlets/ProjectHome" test="true">Ankh SVN</a> is out, and pretty much rocks.&#xA0; It&apos;s now an SCC adapter, instead of a VS Plugin.&#xA0; This means better VS integration.&#xA0; Not to mention Diff and Merge now works as you would expect.&#xA0; Worth the upgrade, uninstall your old version first.</p>
