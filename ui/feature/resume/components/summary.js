      I have over 20 years of experience with web based applications as a developer and creative problem solver.  I have worked in a number of industries including Banking, Government, Military, Aerospace, Corporate Security and Electronic Commerce.  I enjoy project and contract based development, though am more than open to a full time opportunity in a diverse working environment.
