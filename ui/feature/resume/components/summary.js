      I have over 20 years of experience with web based applications as a developer and creative problem solver.  I have worked in a number of industries including Banking, Government, Military, Aerospace, Corporate Security and Electronic Commerce.  Although I enjoy project and contract based development, I am more than open to a full time opportunity in a diverse working environment.

      I am skilled in a broad range of technologies, and have worked throughout the entire chain of web based application development from rich front ends, backend communications and database development.  I was the founder and organizer for the JavaScript-AZ User Group (founded 2009, disbanded 2010), as well as active participant in several other local technology based community organizations (ASP.Net, Node-AZ, Phoenix JS).
