          Co-developed an application which was migrated from an
          MS-Access back-end/front-end to an MS-SQL back-end with two front
          end interfaces a modified MS-Access front-end for internal use,
          and a Classic ASP front-end for external and client use.  The
          data layer was abstracted via a COM interface to ease the
          migration from a standalone Access Application.
