          <u>Web Check-In</u>:<br />
          Worked on creating a modern web front end for the web check-in portion of the website.  
          Utilized HTML 5 based tagging, as well as enhanced features utilizing CSS3 (with CSS3PIE 
          for Ie6-8 Support).  The server-side code utilized C# with ASP.Net MVC (version 2) along 
          with custom integration utilizing jQuery, jQuery-Validation extensions, and jQuery Metadata 
          extensions.  Utilized modern techniques in CSS/JavaScript minify and merge.  Created complex 
          interactions utilizing events, custom UI controls, and implemented features for simplified 
          communications via Ajax/JSON.  The back-end communications utilized several service broker 
          layers written in C#.  Unit testing was done with VSUnit and Moq for the main mocking 
          framework.  The overall changes created a UI that was consistent with the existing site, but 
          reduced the overall payload by well over half, and improved page load time by a factor of 10.

          <u>Other</u>:<br />
          Reduced various scripted entries, unified the work done for date entries, and modified the 
          time based results through the front-end and service layers to allow for an easier 
          configuration of both beginning of day, and end of day for search criteria.
